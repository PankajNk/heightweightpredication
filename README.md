   and finally Heroku for colud deployment

   * Templated -- contains the index.html basiclly Frontend ,
   * Procfile -- which is used by Heruko as first file,
   * heightWeightmodel.pkle -- pickle file,
   * heightWeight.ipynb -- notebook file where we appled the Ml model,
   * main_app.py -- is the main file of Flask ,
